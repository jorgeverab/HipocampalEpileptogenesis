Load all the procedures into Igor session. The three first procedures works together to simulate the neurons and performe ZAP stimulation. they are all commented with instructions written in the header. The last two procedures contain the scripts to do the resonance and firing analysis, respectivelly. Any question find me in jorgeverab@gmail.com.
